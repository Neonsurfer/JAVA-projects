Hi!

This is my first commit to this branch.
In this branch I will be making a small tutorial for JAVA.


Hello World is the most basic program for every language.
This project only contains HelloWorld, and nothing else.
To make sure that NetBeansIDE and JAVA is set up correctly, just try to run HelloWorld.


Hope you enjoy!
