# JAVA-projects

Dear reader!

This branch of mine, will be a place for my JAVA tutorials.
The aim of these will be to make this programming language easily understandable, and learnable for everyone.
I will try to explain everything as I go along.

---
If you want to only check the source of a project, select the given tutorial part, then
go to the src folder. It will contain the raw .java files, which can be previewed.

---
The branches will contain NetBeans projects.
